# Cucumber JSON testdata generator

This repository generates Cucumber JSON reports using several different
Cucumber implementations.

The lack of a schema for Cucumber JSON means different implementations
are slightly inconsistent, and the testdata generated by this project
makes it easier for developers to work around these inconsistencies.

## Installation

    bundle
    yarn

## Regenerating testdata

The JSON reports are generated into the `features` directory.

    make clean
    make

Then, generate the JSON files for SpecFlow:

    # Temporarily remove "no name" feature files (SpecFlow can't handle them)
    rm features/*-nn.feature
    make specflow
    # Restore removed "no name" feature files
    git checkout features/*-nn.feature
